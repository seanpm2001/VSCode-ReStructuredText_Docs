Linter
^^^^^^
The linter support is based on `Cody Hoover's ruby-linter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.ruby-linter>`_.

Live Preview
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The initial idea was brought from `Thomas Haakon Townsend's ReStructured Text Previewer <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tht13.rst-vscode>`_,
but soon after moving fully to Sphinx, this extension becomes its own beast.

IntelliSense
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The IntelliSense support is provided by the `Esbonio Language Server <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio>`_.
